### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš€I'm aucker, I'm trying to write my blog to record something about my life.

I'm currently a third year graduate student, here is my [resume](https://aucker.github.io/files/resume.pdf), it looks not good, but I'm trying to do some works in my last year of school to make it looks better.

I'm now learning Rust and Go.

I'm a super fun of Soulslike and [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania) games, I played *Bloodborne*, *Dark Souls III*, *Sekiro*, *Elden Ring*, *Hollow Knight* a lot.

<!-- ```rust
struct Portfolio;

impl Portfolio {
    const NAME: &'static str = "aucker";
    const LOCATION: &'static str = "Harbin, China";
    const PROFILE: &'static str = "MSc.";
    const EXPERIENCE: &'static str = "5+ years";
}

struct Skills;

impl Skills {
    const LANGUAGES: [&'static str; 5] = ["Rust", "C/C++", "JavaScript", "Golang", "Python", "Kotlin/Java"];
    const OPERATION_SYSTEMS: [&'static str; 3] = ["macOS", "Linux", "Windows"];
    const STORAGES: [&'static str; 5] = ["PostgreSQL", "Elasticsearch", "MongoDB", "Redis", "MySQL"];
    const MESSAGE_QUEUES: [&'static str; 3] = ["Kafka", "RocketMQ", "RabbitMQ"];
    const WEB_FRAMEWORKS: [&'static str; 4] = ["Actix-Web", "Rocket"];
    const DEVOPS: [&'static str; 3] = ["Docker", "Kubernetes"];
}
